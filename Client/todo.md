# Client todo

- improve UI
    * Modify Data:
        + modify pin (name, state)
        + modify sequence
        + close sequence page if corresponding pin is deleted [implemented]
        + input validation
        + bind keys to buttons
    * Improved data handling
        + client side caching (store data in a cache, so the model has to load it only once)
        + all ViewModels should use the same KoObservables
        + be prepared for server side updates
- Login/Logout
    * authentication [implemented]
    * delete all stored data on logout
    * whene user logs in, return to the last page which raised the "not authenticated" exception
- Overview Page
- typings
    * type for cherrytree router
    * type for ViewModel constructor param

- BUGS:
    * deleting newly created sequences raises 404 [implemented]
