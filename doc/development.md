# Development Installation 

Here you will learn how to install this project on your PC. Because this project is intended for usage with a raspberry pi there will be no real switching of GPIOs (also your PC may not have those).

## Requirements

The following software has to be installed.

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Node Package Manager (npm)

## Prepare Flask-Backend

At first i recommend to create a virtual environment using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Install Virtualenv:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
cd <ProjectFolder>/Flask-Server
virtualenv venv
```
Activate it:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then you need to install the backend dependencies.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Befor the backend can now be started, you need to initialize the database. This is done with the following command, which will exit after its done.

```
python3 server.py --create --file schedule.sqlite
```

To run the backend, just leaveout the '--create' option. This command will run until its killed.

```
python3 server.py --file schedule.sqlite
```

## Prepare Frontent


Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-root>/Client
npm install
```

##  Start the development Server

To run the website you need to serve the frontend and the backend. The frontend are just static files which will be served by gulp. All request for the url `/api` which are send to the frontend server are redirected to the backend server. Therefor both server has to run simultaneously.

### Start the backend

```bash
cd <project-root>/Flask-Server
source venv/bin/activate
python3 server.py --file schedule.sqlite
```

Options for server.py:

`--create` creates a new database and erases the old if it exists.

`--debug` runs the server in debug mode.

`--file <path-to-file>` is the path to the file where the schedule is stored.

### run the frontend

```bash
cd <project-root>/Client
gulp
```
